# DISCLAIMER

_I didn't have the time to properly handle credentials within the 30-minute timebox and didn't want to temper with the result, so I kept it as it was, as much as it pains me to do so. I just added the DEMO_KEY in its place in the last commit, but the test commit is still in the commit three._

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- NASA API Key (optional - uses DEMO_KEY by default)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate Hive adapters**
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Configure NASA API Key** (Optional)
   - Get your free API key from [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov)
   - Update `lib/config/api_config.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String nasaApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 📱 Usage

### Main Screen
- **Browse** the latest 30 days of NASA APOD entries
- **Search** by tapping the search icon in the app bar
- **Pull down** to refresh data from NASA API
- **Tap any card** to view detailed information

### Detail Screen
- **View high-resolution images** with zoom capability
- **Read full descriptions** and metadata
- **Share** APOD content (button available)
- **Navigate back** using the back button or gesture

### Offline Mode
- App works completely offline using cached data
- Visual indicator shows when displaying cached content
- Automatic sync when internet connection is restored

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
App Start → Load from Hive Cache → Display Instantly
     ↓
Background API Refresh → Update Cache → Update UI
     ↓
User Searches → Filter Cached Data → Real-time Results
```

### Key Technologies
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Hive**: Fast, lightweight NoSQL database
- **HTTP**: NASA API communication
- **Cached Network Image**: Efficient image loading and caching
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI components

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod`
- **Rate Limiting**: Handles NASA API rate limits gracefully
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Data Validation**: Robust JSON parsing and validation

### Caching Strategy
- **Write-through Cache**: All API responses automatically cached
- **Cache-first Loading**: Prioritizes cached data for instant startup
- **Smart Refresh**: Background updates without blocking UI
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Manages cache size and freshness
